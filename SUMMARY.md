# Summary

## Comments

A classic assignment but a fun one nevertheless. I hadn't touched Kotlin in a while so getting back into it was interesting.
Would recommend to a friend.

I did receive the assignment quite a while ago but didn't really have time for it so in the end I had about 3 evenings to finish it up. 
Had to cut some corners at the end like additional testing, logging, fancier authentication etc. Overall not too shabby though If I say so myself.

Halfway through I made a small React/TS frontend for the application as well. Should be included in the handover files.

I had no problems understanding the assignment, it was short but well documented! Unless I missed something...  ¯\\_(ツ)_/¯


## Which part of the assignment took the most time and why?

Setup took quite a while since as  I mentioned I hadn't touched Kotlin in a while and I
1. had to migrate from an earlier version and
2. needed time to get my bearings

Other than setup, testing took the most time since I kept finding tiny things that I missed. I 100% intentionally left some for you to find as well.

## What You learned

Mostly more about Kotlin/Spring syntax. 

Maybe a bit about time management as well, shouldn't get carried away with frontend whimsies in the middle of a project...

## TODOs

1. Finish up frontend. Currently it displays a list of metadata, allows for file uploads and displays pictures.
2. More tests. Always more tests. 
3. Logging barely got any attention. Need to actually log stuff.
4. Refactor code, especially around the tests. Each test should live its own, class-based, file-based life.
5. Authentication. I won't tell anybody about hunter2 though.
6. Security-related issues like more validation on user inputs or rate limiting requests etc
